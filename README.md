# Apollyon 

## Plans:
> Reimplement Co-routines

> Much more commands
## A basic c++ discord bot

### Very early in development right now, give me some time.


## Setting up the project to launch your bot.
> Create a new discord bot at discord.gg/developers

> Copy the token, and add it to your environment variables as "BOT_TOKEN"

> Follow the build instructions!

## Building the project.
### This is currently untested! This is my first time using cmake, but I think it should work.
### This only works on linux as far as I know.

> Go into the build directory and run "cmake .."

> Go back to the root of the project, and run "cmake --build build/ -j4", changing 4 to the amount of threads you want.

> Them you can go into build and run ./appolyon!
